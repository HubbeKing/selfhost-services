    # Root login is not allowed for auditing reasons. This is because it's difficult to track which process belongs to which root user:
    #
    # On Linux, user sessions are tracking using a kernel-side session id, however, this session id is not recorded by OpenSSH.
    # Additionally, only tools such as systemd and auditd record the process session id.
    # On other OSes, the user session id is not necessarily recorded at all kernel-side.
    # Using regular users in combination with /bin/su or /usr/bin/sudo ensure a clear audit track.
